# Plant Disease Classification (PyTorch)

This repository contains my coursework for the **Advanced AI module** at Loughborough University, where it achieved a grade of **94/100**.  

The task was to create a **tutorial-style AI pipeline** in Jupyter Notebook, guiding readers through the process of building and evaluating a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in PyTorch to classify plant leaf diseases using the **PlantVillage dataset** (freely available on Kaggle).

## Contents
- **Notebook (`.ipynb`)** – step-by-step AI pipeline tutorial with explanations and code.  
- **Report (`.html`)** – exported walkthrough showing the complete workflow.  

The pipeline covers:
- Data preprocessing & augmentation  
- Custom CNN architecture in PyTorch  
- Training, validation, and test evaluation  
- Hyperparameter experiments (learning rate, dropout, batch size)  
- Visualisation of results and performance

## Relevance
Although framed around agriculture, this project demonstrates key, transferable data skills:  
- Working with large, messy datasets  
- Building and validating predictive models  
- Experimenting with hyperparameters to improve performance  
- Communicating results clearly through both visuals and narrative

## How to Use
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to run the tutorial interactively.  
2. Or view the `.html` report directly for a read-only version of the full pipeline and results.

## Dataset
This project uses the **PlantVillage dataset**, a freely available dataset of labelled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.  

The dataset source and usage details are provided in the included HTML report.
