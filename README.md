# Plant Disease Classification (PyTorch)

This project was completed as part of my **Advanced AI module** at Loughborough University, where it received a grade of **94/100**.  

The aim was to build and evaluate a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in PyTorch to classify plant leaf diseases using the **PlantVillage** dataset which is freely available on Kaggle.

The full workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualisation, is documented in the notebook and HTML export provided in this repository.
